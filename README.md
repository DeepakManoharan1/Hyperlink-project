# Workout Plan Hyperlinker

## Overview

This Python script enhances a workout plan by automatically converting exercise names into clickable hyperlinks. These links direct to Google search results, providing instant explanations for each exercise.

## Features

- Identifies exercise names wrapped in `**double asterisks**` in a DOCX file.
- Converts these names into clickable hyperlinks that open relevant Google searches.
- Saves the updated workout plan with hyperlinks to a new DOCX file.

## How It Works

1. The script searches for any text surrounded by `**double asterisks**`.
2. It replaces the text with a hyperlink to a Google search for that exercise.
3. The result is a workout plan where you can click on exercise names to quickly find more information.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install the required libraries:
    ```
    pip install python-docx
    ```
2. Update the file paths in the script:
    ```python
    file_path = r"path\to\your\workout_plan.docx"
    output_path = r"path\to\save\your\workout_plan_with_links.docx"
    ```

3. Run the script using Python:
    ```
    python workout_hyperlinker.py
    ```

4. The modified document with hyperlinks will be saved at the specified location.

## Example

In your workout plan, text like:
```
**Push-up**
**Squat**
```
will be converted to clickable links that direct to Google search results.
